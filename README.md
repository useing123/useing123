I’ve been interested in coding things since 2016 - starting with Minecraft mods and servers - and never really stopped. What began as curiosity turned into a full-on obsession with solving complex problems, shipping products, and turning ideas into real tools people actually want to use.

In 2023, I went deep into AI - reading 20+ papers on prompting and image generation, exploring Stable Diffusion, and building LLM-based tools *before* LangChain or LangSmith became the norm. I don’t wait for frameworks - I build.
