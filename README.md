# 👋 Hey, I'm Ossein

I’ve been building things since 4th grade — starting with Minecraft mods and servers — and never really stopped. What began as curiosity turned into a full-on obsession with solving complex problems, shipping products, and turning ideas into real tools people actually want to use.

In 2023, I went deep into AI — reading 20+ papers on prompting and image generation, exploring Stable Diffusion, and building LLM-based tools *before* LangChain or LangSmith became the norm. I don’t wait for frameworks — I build.

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- 🧩 Solving UX and agent logic challenges  
- 🧠 Graph-based AI agents with LangSmith  
- 🌀 Prompt-to-manga pipelines with Stable Diffusion  
- 📊 Full-stack analytics with PostHog + custom tracking  
- ⚡ FastAPI, Nuxt 2, Next.js, and Python everywhere  
- 🧪 Reading papers > chasing trends  

## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🎨 Manga Generation App  
An autonomous pipeline that creates manga from a single prompt — combining story generation via ChatGPT and image synthesis via Stable Diffusion.  
**Stack:** Nuxt 2, FastAPI, ChatGPT API, Stable Diffusion

### 📈 Full-stack Marketing Analytics  
Built custom UTM tracking, pixel capture, and a dashboard powered by PostHog. API integration, tagging, and 100% accurate attribution — no fluff.  
**Stack:** NextJS, PostHog, custom tracking pixel, FastAPI

## 💡 My Strengths

- 🧠 Strong at designing agent logic & prompt engineering  
- ⚙️ Love shipping — fast iteration, learning by building  
- 🎨 UX-first mindset (was close to switching to product design pre-GPT boom)  
- 🚀 High learning rate and bias toward action  

## 🧭 Looking For

- 🏢 Startups solving interesting real-world problems  
- 🌱 Open-source projects with strong communities  
- 🤝 Collaborators who care about UX and product impact  

## 🌱 Currently

- Building in stealth (AI agent x UX-focused tool)  
- Prepping open-source releases  
- Always open to collab or startup work
